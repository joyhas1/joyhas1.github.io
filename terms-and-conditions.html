Only the Team Owner may assign a new Team Owner.

The arbitration will be conducted through videoconferencing or at an agreed location reasonably convenient to both parties. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator may include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. All Claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator or a court may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Canva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
